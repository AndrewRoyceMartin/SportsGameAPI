Yep — I can see the pushed stats_provider.py on GitHub now.

And it confirms why your AFL/NRL matching is still failing:

What’s still wrong in the live GitHub file
1) AFL/NRL preseason is still being blocked

Your _TOURNAMENT_DENY includes "preseason" / "pre-season" and _parse_game() applies it unconditionally:

if any(deny in league_lower for deny in _TOURNAMENT_DENY):
    return None


So AFL/NRL preseason games will still get filtered out (fixtures fetched becomes 0 or very low), even though Sportsbet has odds.

2) NBL filter is still too broad

NBL route accept is ["nbl", "australia"] and _matches_league() is just any(pat in gl for pat in accept). That can still match a lot of non-Australian “NBL” leagues depending on how SofaScore labels them.

Fix it cleanly (exact patch)
A) Add a flag to bypass tournament deny per league
1) Update _LeagueRoute
@dataclass
class _LeagueRoute:
    sport: str
    accept: list
    skip_tournament_deny: bool = False

2) Set flags in _LEAGUE_ROUTING
"AFL": _LeagueRoute(sport="aussie-rules", accept=["afl", "australian football"], skip_tournament_deny=True),
"NRL": _LeagueRoute(sport="rugby", accept=["nrl", "national rugby league"], skip_tournament_deny=True),
"NBL": _LeagueRoute(sport="basketball", accept=["nbl"], skip_tournament_deny=False),

B) Pass skip_tournament_deny into _parse_game
3) Change _parse_game signature and deny check
def _parse_game(ev: Dict[str, Any], *, skip_tournament_deny: bool = False) -> Optional[Game]:
    ...
    if not skip_tournament_deny and any(deny in league_lower for deny in _TOURNAMENT_DENY):
        return None

4) Change _collect_games to pass the flag
game = _parse_game(ev, skip_tournament_deny=route.skip_tournament_deny)

Tighten NBL matching (avoid “Czechia NBL”, “Uganda NBL Women”, etc.)
Best approach: special-case NBL in _matches_league

Change _matches_league to accept a league_key:

def _matches_league(game_league_str: str, accept: list, *, league_key: str = "") -> bool:
    gl = game_league_str.lower()

    if league_key == "NBL":
        # Your league string includes "(Australia)" already, so leverage it.
        return "nbl" in gl and "(australia)" in gl and "women" not in gl

    return any(pat in gl for pat in accept)


Then in _collect_games, call it like this:

if league and not _matches_league(game.league, route.accept, league_key=league):
    continue


This is much safer than growing a giant deny list.
