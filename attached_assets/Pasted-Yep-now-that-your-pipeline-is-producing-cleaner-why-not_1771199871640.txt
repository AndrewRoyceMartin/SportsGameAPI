Yep — now that your pipeline is producing cleaner “why nothing matched / why nothing passed filters” signals, the GUI can do a lot more guiding instead of just displaying.

Below are the highest-impact UI upgrades (Streamlit-friendly) to make the app feel like a “betting assistant” rather than a dashboard.

1) Make the workflow explicit: 3-step “funnel” at the top

On Place Bets, add a simple Stepper-style header:

Choose scan (League / All)

Set risk (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive + Confidence Target)

Review picks (Best Bet → shortlist → bet slip)

Why it helps: you stop hunting around the sidebar and tabs.

Implementation idea (app.py):

Put a st.container() at the top of Place Bets with:

A one-line summary of current scan scope

A “Run scan” button (primary)

A compact “current rules” pill row (edge %, min odds, confidence target, lookahead)

2) Convert your “Best Bet Right Now” into a proper decision card

Your hero card is great — make it actionable:

Add:

Stake suggestion mode: Flat stake / Kelly-lite / Custom

Confidence calibration hint: show “Backtest says: at 65%+ you historically hit X%” (even if it’s only from last run)

Why this is #1: one short sentence using your quality components

Example: “Edge +8.2% with mature ratings and sane odds.”

This turns it into “do I place this bet?” not “here’s a pick”.

3) Add a “Bet Builder” rail on the right (sticky-style)

Instead of the bet slip living below everything, make it a right column.

Layout on Place Bets:

Left (wide): cards

Right (narrow): Bet Builder

Stake per bet

Max total outlay cap

“Add all A-tier” button

“Add top 3” button

Copy/CSV

Streamlit pattern:

left, right = st.columns([3, 1])
with right:
    render_bet_slip(...)

4) Make each pick card answer the 3 questions instantly

Every pick should visually answer:

What’s the bet? (team, market, odds)

Why is it value? (Model% vs Market% vs Edge)

How risky is it? (risk tag + maturity + start time)

You already have most of this. The UI tweak is hierarchy:

Card top row:

Team vs Team

Start time (local for AU, local to league otherwise)

Quality badge + Risk tag

Card middle row:

Model% | Market% | Edge (big + bold)

Odds + implied probability

Card bottom row (collapsed by default):

Mini quality breakdown bar

“How calculated” expander (EV formula + consensus)

5) Add “Quick Filters” chips above the cards (not in sidebar)

Sidebar is for configuration. Place Bets should have moment-to-moment filters:

Starts in: Next 6h / 24h / 3d / All

Tier: A / B / C

Risk: Low / Med / High

Market sanity: Hide weird odds

These should feel like “shopping filters” while browsing picks.

6) Turn your Action Strip into a guided next action (with buttons)

Right now it’s messaging. Make it do something.

Examples:

If matched == 0 and reason is naming → show button: Open Fix Issues tab

If value bets == 0 → show:

Lower min edge to X (button that sets session state)

Widen odds range (button)

If “coverage gap” → show:

Extend lookahead to 21 days (button)

Streamlit lets you set st.session_state[...] directly when clicking.

7) Add a “Best Bets Shortlist” mode that feels like a final recommendation

When Best Bets Mode is ON, explicitly label it:

“Shortlist (recommended)” with a count like “Top 10 picks”

Display a “Portfolio view” summary above the cards:

Total outlay (if slip populated)

Avg edge

Avg confidence

Earliest start

This makes it feel like curated output.

8) Improve “Browse All” to be a discovery tool, not a duplicate view

Browse All should answer: “What else exists if I relax my rules?”

Add:

A small toggle: Show near-misses (e.g., edge within 1–2% of threshold)

Column: Fail reason (too low edge / odds out of range / low confidence)

A slider: “Show bets down to edge = X%” without changing saved defaults

This makes Browse All useful for tuning without breaking your main run.

9) Track Results tab: make it “feedback loop” for model trust

To improve usability and future accuracy work:

Add “Mark outcome” buttons (Won/Lost/Void) beside saved picks

Show rolling stats:

ROI

Hit rate by confidence bucket

Hit rate by tier (A/B/C)

Show “Model vs Market” calibration plot later (optional)

Even a simple table + summary metrics will make this feel like a system you can learn from.

10) AU leagues specifically: reduce confusion with “season state” labels

For AFL/NRL in preseason/early season:

Add a banner above results:

“AFL currently includes preseason games (experimental mapping)”

Add a small tag on those fixtures: Preseason

Default to a longer lookahead for AFL automatically (you already do 21 days, keep it visible)

This will stop the “why no fixtures / why unmatched” spiral for AU sports.
