Replit’s assessment is solid, and it aligns with the right direction.

The key improvement from their suggestion is this:

Users should not orchestrate the pipeline

The app should run availability + odds probe + matching + filtering automatically

Diagnostics should appear only when needed

That’s exactly the right UX principle for your app now.

Combined Recommendation (best of both plans)
The best path forward

Use a guided default experience and keep expert tooling available.

Core idea

Default = “Find Bets” (simple, one-click flow)

Advanced = hidden behind expanders / Settings

Diagnostics = inline when something fails

Trust/Tuning/Backtest = still available, but not blocking the main path

This gives you:

fast everyday usability

retained power for tuning accuracy

fewer user mistakes

less “why is this empty?” confusion

Final UX structure to build (recommended)
Tabs (reduce to 3)
1) Find Bets (default)

This becomes the main working screen:

league selection

one-click scan

top picks cards

bet builder / shortlist

optional “show all results”

inline diagnostics if no results

2) My Picks

saved picks

result marking (won/lost/void)

rolling performance stats

tier/confidence hit rate summaries

3) Settings & Model

Contains the expert tools:

profiles

advanced filters

Elo tuning

backtest

diagnostics

provider/odds debug panels

This preserves all your current features without forcing them into the main workflow.

What to change in behavior (most important)
1) Make “Find Value Bets” do everything automatically

When user clicks Find Value Bets, the app should internally do:

Check fixtures (SofaScore)

Probe/fetch odds (Harvest or Sportsbet)

Match fixtures to odds

Compute values

Apply filters

Show results (or a precise reason why not)

User should not need to click “Check Availability” first

Keep “Check Availability” as a secondary / small link button (optional), but not required.

2) Replace “Check Availability” as a required step with “pre-scan readiness”

Before scan results render (or during progress), show:

Fixtures found ✅/❌

Odds provider + raw odds count ✅/❌

Matched games ✅/❌

Tuned/default model status ✅/ℹ️

This gives the same transparency, but without requiring manual workflow.

3) Merge Place Bets + Browse All into one page

Replit is right here.

In Find Bets tab:

Top picks cards first (actionable)

“Show all matched games” expander below (discovery)

“Show near misses” toggle inside that expander

This reduces tab switching and keeps context.

4) Keep a visible “Next Best Action” panel

This is still one of your strongest UX improvements.

Examples:

“No fixtures found in 7-day window. Try 21 days for AFL preseason.”

“Odds provider returned 0 events. This is a provider issue, not your settings.”

“Matched games found but no bets passed filters. Lower edge to 2% or confidence to 60%.”

“Using default Elo settings. Run Quick Calibrate for better league-specific picks.”

This is what makes the app feel smart.

How to make the app more useful for accuracy, not just usability

You asked for usability and better picks. UX should support the prediction workflow.

Recommended default flow in Find Bets

Select league

Scan (automatic pipeline)

If model not tuned for that league:

show “Quick Calibrate Recommended”

one button to run quick calibrate

Re-scan with tuned params (one click)

Review top picks

Add to bet builder

This teaches the user the right order without making them think about it.

What to keep visible vs hide
Keep visible (default)

League selector

Find Value Bets (main button)

Confidence target (minimum model confidence)

Min edge

Odds range preset

Quick Calibrate (secondary button)

Top picks cards

Bet builder summary / shortlist

Hide in “Advanced” expander

Elo parameter controls (K, home advantage, half-life, scale)

Scan profiles internals

Odds provider diagnostics

Raw mapping/debug tables

Backtest controls (or link to Settings & Model)

Naming changes that will improve comprehension immediately

These are small but high-impact.

Confidence Target → Minimum model confidence

Trust & Tuning → Settings & Model

Fix Issues → remove tab; show inline diagnostics

Browse All → move into “Show all matches” expander

Quick Calibrate → Quick tune model (this league)

Tooltips should explain:

model confidence

market implied probability

edge

quality score

why a pick is ranked highly

Recommended implementation plan (staged, low-risk for Replit)
Stage 1 (UX foundation, highest value)

Goal: Make Find Bets one-click and reduce cognitive load.

Changes

Create/rename default tab to Find Bets

Keep existing tabs but begin consolidation

Make Find Value Bets run full pipeline automatically (including availability/odds probing)

Add progress/status strip during scan

Add Next Best Action panel

Move most controls into Advanced expander

Render top picks + all results in one page

✅ Biggest usability win with minimal algorithm risk.

Stage 2 (Tab consolidation)

Goal: Reduce clutter and unify workflow.

Changes

Merge Place Bets + Browse All into Find Bets

Move Fix Issues into inline diagnostics + optional Settings panel

Keep My Picks (Track Results)

Rename Trust & Tuning to Settings & Model

✅ Cleaner information architecture.

Stage 3 (Model workflow guidance)

Goal: Help users get more accurate predictions by following the right sequence.

Changes

Detect whether league has tuned Elo params

If not tuned, show “Quick tune model recommended”

After quick tuning, prompt to re-scan

Add “Scan using tuned params” confirmation badge

Optional: one-click “Quick tune + scan”

✅ Improves real-world use of your new calibration system.

Stage 4 (Advanced trust & diagnostics polish)

Goal: Keep expert visibility without cluttering daily use.

Changes

Inline diagnostic expander only when no results / warnings

Provider/raw counts/match counts shown in compact trust panel

Deep debug tables still available in Settings & Model

✅ Power users stay happy, normal users stay focused.

Replit instructions (copy/paste)

Use this as your next instruction to Replit (kept staged to avoid overload):

Use the current app and helper structure, but refactor the UX to make the app much easier to use for finding bets.

Implement Stage 1 only (incremental, app-safe):

GOAL
Make the default experience a simple one-click scan flow where the user does NOT need to manually run Check Availability first.

CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT
1) Make the main/default workflow tab "Find Bets" (you can rename or repurpose the current Place Bets tab).
2) In Find Bets, keep only the essential controls visible by default:
   - League selector
   - Find Value Bets button (primary)
   - Quick tune model (this league) button (secondary)
   - Minimum model confidence
   - Min edge
   - Odds range preset
3) Move non-essential controls (profiles, advanced filters, debug options, tuning parameters, etc.) into an "Advanced" expander (collapsed by default).
4) Change Find Value Bets so it automatically performs the full pipeline in one click:
   - fixtures check
   - odds probe/fetch
   - matching
   - value computation
   - filtering
   - result rendering
   Reuse existing availability/odds probing logic internally (do not remove it).
5) Add a scan progress/status panel (or progress bar) that clearly shows pipeline stages while scanning.
6) Add a persistent "Next Best Action" panel near the top of Find Bets that explains exactly what the user should do next based on state/results.
   Examples:
   - no fixtures -> extend lookahead / switch league
   - odds empty -> provider issue / try later
   - no matches -> likely round/date mismatch
   - no bets -> lower min edge / confidence target
   - model defaults active -> recommend quick tuning
7) Keep diagnostics contextual:
   - If the scan fails or returns no results, show inline diagnostic summary/expander in Find Bets (reuse current diagnostic helpers where possible).
   - Do NOT force users to switch tabs to understand no-result states.
8) In Find Bets results area, show:
   - top picks cards first
   - shortlist/bet builder summary
   - "Show all matches/results" expander below (instead of requiring a separate Browse All tab for normal use)
   Reuse existing render helpers (hero card, pick cards, quick filters, bet builder, shortlist summary) where possible.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep all current advanced functionality intact (backtest, tuning, diagnostics, saved picks).
- Do not remove existing tabs yet; this is a Stage 1 UX refactor only.
- Preserve session_state keys and existing pipeline logic as much as possible.
- Keep changes incremental and app-running-safe.
