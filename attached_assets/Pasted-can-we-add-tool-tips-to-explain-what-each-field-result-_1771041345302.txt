can we add tool tips - to explain what each field result means and to explain what all filters mean in plain english.

Yes — and it’s a high-value change because it prevents misuse.

Here’s the clean, Streamlit-native way to do it without cluttering the UI:

Step T1: Add tooltips to sidebar filters

Streamlit supports tooltips via the help= parameter on most widgets.

Example pattern
min_edge = st.slider(
    "Min Edge %",
    0.0, 0.20, 0.03,
    help="Minimum difference between the model probability and the market-implied probability. Higher = fewer picks."
)

Suggested plain-English tooltips (copy/paste)

League

help: "Choose the sport/league to scan. Production leagues are 2-outcome markets. Experimental leagues may overstate edge (e.g., soccer draw risk)."

Min Edge %

help: "Only show bets where the model's win probability is at least this much higher than the market-implied probability. Example: 5% means model 55% vs market 50%."

Odds Range

help: "Only consider bets with decimal odds inside this range. Lower odds = favourites; higher odds = underdogs. Narrowing this can reduce volatility."

Max Results / Top N

help: "Show at most this many top-ranked bets after filtering. Ranked by expected value (EV/unit)."

Elo History (days)

help: "How far back to build team ratings from past results. Longer = more stable; shorter = more responsive to recent form."

Lookahead (days) (if you have it)

help: "How many days ahead to search for upcoming fixtures and odds. If odds aren't posted yet, try a shorter window or a date closer to game time."

Step T2: Add tooltips / explanations for result columns

Tables don’t have per-column hover tooltips, so the best UX is:

A “What do these columns mean?” expander above the table

Inside, use plain English bullet points

Drop-in expander block
with st.expander("What do these results mean?"):
    st.markdown(
        """
**Match / Date / Time**: The event and scheduled start time (UTC).

**Pick**: The side the model rates as the best value (highest EV) for this match.

**Odds**: Consensus decimal odds from the books (median across sportsbooks).

**Model %**: The model's estimated chance this pick wins.

**Implied %**: The market's implied chance from the odds (≈ 1 / odds).

**Edge**: Model % − Implied %. Positive edge means the model thinks the market underprices this outcome.

**EV/unit**: Expected profit per 1 unit staked (EV = ModelProb × Odds − 1).  
Example: EV/unit = 0.10 means +0.10 units expected return per 1 unit bet (before commissions/limits).

**Elo H / Elo A**: The model strength ratings for the two teams/participants used to generate Model %.
        """
    )

Step T3: Add tooltips to diagnostics panel

If you’re showing metrics like:

Odds games fetched

With posted lines

Fixtures fetched

Matched

Value bets

Add a short “info” expander:

with st.expander("How to read diagnostics"):
    st.markdown(
        """
- **Odds games fetched**: How many events the odds source returned.
- **With posted lines**: How many events have actual moneyline prices available (not blank).
- **Fixtures fetched**: How many upcoming events were found in the stats source.
- **Matched**: How many fixtures were paired to odds successfully.
- **Value bets**: How many picks passed your filters.
        """
    )
