Yep — now’s the right time to polish the GUI, because you’ve added enough power (sport filter, league search, profiles, lock defaults, unmatched diagnostics) that the UI needs to lead you instead of just exposing knobs.

Here’s a high-impact UI redesign plan that fits your current architecture (app.py thin + ui_helpers.py owns UI) and directly guides you to “best bets to place”.

1) Reframe the app around a “Betting Decision Flow”

Right now the user experience is “configure → run → look at a table”.

Make it “Pick league → Run → Bet shortlist → Verify → Save”.

New top-level layout (tabs)

✅ Picks (Recommended) (default tab)

🔎 Explore (all matched games + filters)

🧪 Diagnostics (only when needed)

📒 Saved Picks (history + tracking later)

This stops the app feeling like a debug tool.

2) Picks tab: A “Bet Slip” style shortlist (what to actually bet)

On Picks, don’t show a big dataframe first. Show:

A) “Today / Next 24h” switch

A simple toggle:

Next 24h (default)

Lookahead window

Because bettors mostly act near-term.

B) “Top Bets” cards (not a table)

For the top N (e.g., 5–10), display cards with:

Match (Home vs Away)

Start time (local time + UTC in tooltip)

Pick (Team) + Odds

Model % vs Implied %

Edge %

EV/unit

Confidence score

Consensus book(s) used

And a single primary action:

✅ Add to Bet Slip

C) Bet Slip panel (right column or expander)

A curated list of selected bets with:

stake input (flat default, later Kelly)

expected return summary

“Remove” buttons

✅ Save slip (writes to SQLite via existing store)

This makes it feel like a wagering tool, not a data science output.

3) Add a “Quality Score” to rank bets intelligently

Right now you have Edge and EV. With multiple providers + AU quirks, add a composite rank that reflects “bettable quality”.

Suggested “Bet Quality” score (0–100)

Weighted:

Edge% (scaled)

EV/unit (scaled)

Confidence (match_confidence + model confidence)

Market sanity checks:

penalise extreme odds (very longshots) unless edge is huge

penalise low consensus agreement (if you track dispersion across books)

Display as:

Quality: 82/100 (Strong)

with a tooltip: “High edge, strong mapping confidence, odds in preferred range”.

This becomes your default sort in Picks.

4) Sidebar: simplify controls using “Basic / Advanced”

Your sidebar is doing a lot now (sport filter, league search, profiles, lock defaults, min edge, odds range, lookahead, history, top N…).

Split it:

Basic (always visible)

Sport dropdown

Search leagues

League dropdown

Run profile (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)

Run button

Advanced (expander)

Min edge

Odds range

Lookahead days

History days

Top N

Column toggles (move to Explore tab ideally)

And keep your “Defaults applied…” line — it’s excellent.

This reduces cognitive load massively.

5) Improve the empty states into “What to do next” prompts

Your new empty-state diagnosis is already strong. Make it actionable:

If coverage_gap

Show buttons:

Extend lookahead (+7 days)

Try a closer window (Next 24h)

Switch to a league with active fixtures (NBL)

If naming

Show:

“Top mismatch pair suggestions” (just 3–5)

A button: Copy alias template (pre-filled lines like "gws giants": "greater western sydney giants")

If “odds exist, no fixtures”

Show:

“Stats source hasn’t published this round yet”

Quick action: Switch stats window forward (date_to +7)

These turn frustration into guidance.

6) Explore tab: keep your dataframe, but make it “scannable”

For Explore:

Default columns: Match, Start, Pick, Odds, Edge, EV, Quality

Hide Elo columns by default (already done)

Add row highlight via a “Tier label” column:

Tier A (Quality ≥ 80)

Tier B (60–79)

Tier C (<60)

Even without colours, the tier label makes scanning easy.

7) Diagnostics tab: isolate noise

Move all this out of the main flow:

“Odds games fetched / fixtures fetched / matched”

429 / 5xx counters

Unmatched samples

And only show an inline hint on Picks:

“Something didn’t match — see Diagnostics → Unmatched Samples”

8) “Best Bets Mode” (one switch that changes behaviour)

Add a toggle in Picks:

Best Bets Mode (ON by default) does:

auto-filters to next 24h

auto-sorts by Quality

limits to Top 5–10

locks defaults on (prevents accidental slider damage)

When OFF, behave like the current power-user mode.

This is the single biggest “user friendly” win.

What file to change

All of this can be done cleanly with:

ui_helpers.py: new render functions (cards, bet slip, quality score, empty-state actions)

app.py: just tabs + call the new helpers

(optional) store.py: add “slip_id” grouping later, but not required now
