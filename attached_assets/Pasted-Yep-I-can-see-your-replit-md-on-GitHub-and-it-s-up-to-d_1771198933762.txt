Yep — I can see your `replit.md` on GitHub and it’s up to date. It already captures the current architecture, supported leagues (including **Sportsbet AU: AFL/NRL/NBL**), the 5-tab UI layout, Best Bets mode, quality scoring, maturity penalty, and the improved diagnostics/backtesting stack. ([GitHub][1])

Now, to make the GUI feel *obvious* and *decision-guiding* (not just “a dashboard”), here’s what I’d change.

---

## 1) Change the mental model: “Find bets” → “Make a decision”

### A. Add a **Top Recommendation panel** at the top of **Picks**

Instead of starting with filters, start with a single card:

* **Best Bet Right Now**

  * Pick (team/side)
  * Stake suggestion (optional, based on your bankroll rules)
  * Why (1 sentence: edge + model confidence + odds sanity + maturity)
  * Risk tag: *Low / Medium / High*
  * “Show next 9” button

This aligns with your existing “Best Bets Mode” + “Why explainer” concept, but makes it the first thing you see. ([GitHub][1])

### B. Add a **“What should I do next?”** strip after every run

One compact, action-oriented message based on pipeline outcome:

* “✅ 10 value bets found — top 3 are Mature teams, odds are within your range.”
* “⚠️ No matches: looks like *coverage gap* — Sportsbook has Round 1, fixtures not published yet.”
* “⚠️ Naming mismatch likely — click to review suggested aliases.”

You already have reason-coded empty states and unmatched diagnostics — this just turns them into a guided next action. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 2) Make filters feel safe: presets + progressive disclosure

### A. Replace most sliders with **3 “Run Styles” buttons**

You already have profiles (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive). Make them big, obvious buttons with a short description:

* **Conservative:** fewer bets, higher edge threshold
* **Balanced:** defaults
* **Aggressive:** more bets, lower edge threshold

Keep the actual sliders inside an “Advanced” expander (you already do this directionally). ([GitHub][1])

### B. Add **“Confidence Target”** as a first-class control

Most users don’t think in “min edge” first. They think: *“How sure am I?”*

Add a simple control:

* Confidence target: **Any / 55%+ / 60%+ / 65%+ / 70%+**
  Then map it internally to:
* min edge (or a minimum model probability threshold)
* and/or a minimum Bet Quality

This directly uses your backtest bucket table logic and makes it actionable.

---

## 3) Add a “Bet Slip” (this is what makes it feel like a real tool)

Create a right-side (or top) **Bet Slip** container:

* Selected picks (from cards/table)
* Total stake
* Optional: max stake per game / per day
* Export buttons:

  * Copy as text
  * CSV export (you already have export patterns)
* Acknowledge checkbox for Experimental leagues (you already gate saves for experimental) ([GitHub][1])

This single change massively improves usability because it turns browsing into an execution workflow.

## 4) Make “Quality” explain itself, visually

You already compute:

* quality score (0–100)
* tier (A/B/C)
* maturity penalty
* “Why” sentence ([GitHub][1])

Upgrade presentation:

### A. Add a **Quality breakdown mini-bar**

On each pick card:

* Edge contribution
* EV contribution
* Confidence contribution
* Odds sanity contribution
* Maturity penalty indicator

People trust what they can *see*.

### B. Add a “Confidence vs Implied” picture

One tiny line:

* Model: 62%
* Market implied: 54%
* Edge: +8%

That’s the whole thesis in one glance.

---

## 5) Make AU leagues feel native (and reduce confusion)

AU users get tripped up by:

* time zones (UTC vs AEDT)
* preseason / future rounds
* naming mismatches across providers

### AU-specific UI polish:

* Display match times in **local time (AEDT/AEST)** with a small “UTC” secondary.
* Add an “AU season context” badge:

  * **Preseason**
  * **Regular season**
  * **Round not yet published in fixtures source** (coverage gap)

This directly addresses the pain you saw with AFL/NRL preseason and the Sportsbet-vs-SofaScore timing/round publishing mismatch.

---

## 6) Make Backtest results drive the Picks tab

Your screenshot suggests overall NBA accuracy ~62.8% and “Confident Picks” ~64.3%, with a strong 80%+ bucket but weaker mid buckets.

Turn that into an automatic “recommended threshold”:

* If bucket lift is small, recommend tightening to 65%+ or require “Mature” teams.
* If calibration is strong (low Brier/log loss), allow more.

In other words: **Backtest → suggested run settings** button:

* “Use backtest-optimised settings for NBA”

This makes your Backtest tab feel like it *improves* the betting experience rather than being a separate “analytics page”. ([GitHub][1])

---

## 7) A concrete revised tab purpose (simple, intuitive)

You already have 5 tabs. Make the labels more user-oriented:

* **Picks (Place Bets)** → shortlist + bet slip
* **Explore (Browse All)** → full table + filters
* **Backtest (Trust & Tuning)** → results + “apply recommended settings”
* **Diagnostics (Fix Issues)** → unmatched + API status + raw samples
* **Saved (Track Results)** → history + performance

This matches what `replit.md` says each module does, but makes it feel like a guided workflow. ([GitHub][1])

If you want, paste your current `app.py` tab layout + the sidebar block (just those sections), and I’ll rewrite them into the “Place Bets + Bet Slip + Apply Backtest Settings” flow without breaking your existing pipeline functions.
