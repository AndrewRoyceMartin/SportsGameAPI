can we add more australian sports

Yes. The best Australian additions (given your 2-outcome first engine) are:

Recommended AU leagues to add next
Production-ready (mostly 2-outcome)

NRL (Rugby League)

AFL (Australian Football League)

NBL (National Basketball League – Australia)

Super Rugby (Pacific) (usually 2-outcome; draw is rare)

Keep Experimental (draw-prone / market complications)

A-League (soccer) → books are typically 3-way (Home/Draw/Away), so your current 2-outcome engine needs either:

a true 3-way model, or

switching to a 2-way market like Draw No Bet (different extraction + modelling assumption)

What you’ll need to change (same pattern as MLB/Tennis)
1) league_map.py

Add:

“AFL”

“NRL”

“NBL”

optional: “Super Rugby”

Mark A-League as Experimental unless you implement a 3-way path.

2) league_defaults.py (starter defaults you can tune)

AFL: history 120, lookahead 7, min edge 3%, odds 1.30–4.50, top 15

NRL: history 120, lookahead 7, min edge 3%, odds 1.30–4.50, top 15

NBL: history 120, lookahead 7, min edge 3%, odds 1.30–4.00, top 15

Super Rugby: history 180, lookahead 7, min edge 3%, odds 1.30–4.50, top 15

3) stats_provider.py routing (SofaScore sport endpoint + accept patterns)

You’ll add routing entries like:

AFL → sport="aussie-rules" (or whatever SofaScore uses for AFL)

NRL → sport="rugby-league"

NBL → sport="basketball"

Super Rugby → sport="rugby-union"

A-League → sport="football" (experimental)

Important: SofaScore “sport” slugs must match their API path; once you confirm each slug, accept patterns usually include tournament names like “AFL”, “NRL”, “NBL”, “Super Rugby”, “A-League”.

4) Odds side (Apify actor input + extraction)

You’ll map each league to the actor’s league identifiers (similar to MLB→“MLB”, ATP→“ATP”). Then ensure odds_extract.py recognises AU naming like:

“Head to Head”

“H2H”

“Moneyline”

“Match Winner”

5) Aliases (the part that always matters)

Add a small alias table per league:

AFL: “GWS” ↔ “Greater Western Sydney Giants”, “Brisbane” ↔ “Brisbane Lions”, etc.

NRL: “Sea Eagles” ↔ “Manly Warringah Sea Eagles”, “Roosters” ↔ “Sydney Roosters”, etc.

NBL: “36ers” ↔ “Adelaide 36ers”, etc.

One GUI guardrail you should enable for AU soccer

Since you’re expanding into AU markets, add a league metadata flag like market_mode = "2way" | "3way".

If user selects A-League while in 2-way mode: show a warning and disable “save picks”.

This prevents confusing “empty” or misleading outputs.
