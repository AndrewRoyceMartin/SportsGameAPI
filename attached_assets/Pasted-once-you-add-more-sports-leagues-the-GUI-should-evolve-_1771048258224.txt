once you add more sports/leagues, the GUI should evolve so it stays fast to use and hard to misconfigure. You don’t need a redesign; a few targeted upgrades will make it feel “production-grade”.

GUI updates worth doing now (minimal change, big payoff)
1) League picker becomes “League + Sport” with search

When you go beyond ~8 leagues, a flat dropdown gets annoying.

Add a Sport filter (All / Basketball / Hockey / Football / Baseball / Tennis / MMA)

Add a search box that filters the league list live

Keep Production leagues above Experimental

Implementation idea (Streamlit):

sport_filter = st.selectbox(...)

search = st.text_input("Search leagues")

Filter the leagues before feeding the selectbox.

2) Auto-defaults should be visible and “sticky”

You already auto-apply defaults on league change — good. Make it obvious:

Show a small “Defaults applied for: NBA” line

Add a “Lock defaults” toggle:

When ON: changing league forces defaults and disables manual edits (prevents accidental bad configs)

When OFF: power-users can tweak

3) Market mode selector (prevents future confusion)

As you add sports, “moneyline/winner” naming differs.
Add a Market dropdown with guardrails:

“Moneyline / Winner (2-outcome)” (default)

“Experimental: Draw markets / 3-way” (disabled or gated)
This keeps soccer/UCL from silently producing nonsense.

4) Better “No value bets” explanations (most common user pain)

When you expand sports, you’ll hit more “empty” runs. Replace generic emptiness with reason codes:

Odds found but no lines posted

Fixtures found but 0 matched (mapping issue)

Matched games but 0 moneylines extracted

Moneylines extracted but 0 pass filters (min edge too high, odds range too tight)
You already have diagnostics counts—just add a one-paragraph explanation based on those counts.

5) “Unmatched samples” expander (debug in the UI)

Add an expander that shows:

Top 10 fixtures that failed to match odds

Top 10 odds events that didn’t map to fixtures
Include their start times and team strings.
This is the single best UI feature for scaling to new leagues.

6) Column toggles + sorting presets for the results table

As more sports come in, the table gets busy.

Checkbox list to show/hide columns (edge, EV/unit, model p, implied p, consensus odds, book count, etc.)

Sorting preset:

“Best EV”

“Highest Edge”

“Soonest Start Time”

“Most Books”

7) Add a “Run profile” selector

Different sports want different defaults. Instead of users tweaking every time:

“Conservative” (higher min edge, tighter odds range)

“Balanced”

“Aggressive” (lower min edge, wider odds range)
This is just a multiplier/override layer on league_defaults.py.

What you don’t need yet

Multi-page navigation redesign

Complex user accounts

A full settings panel with persistence (nice later)

Quick plan (doable without breaking anything)

Add Sport filter + search above league selectbox

Add Reason-coded empty-state messages

Add Unmatched samples expander

Add sorting presets + column toggles
