Below is a repeatable pattern you can follow for any new sport/league, plus concrete recommendations for what to add next.

The “Add a Sport/League” checklist (works every time)
1) Add it to the UI league list

league_map.py

Add a new entry under Production (or Experimental).

2) Add per-league defaults

league_defaults.py

Set:

history_days

lookahead_days

min_edge_pct

odds_min/odds_max

top_n

3) Add SofaScore routing + tournament accept patterns

stats_provider.py

Add an entry in _LEAGUE_ROUTING:

sport="football" | "basketball" | "ice-hockey" | "american-football" | "baseball" | "tennis" | ...

accept=[...] patterns that match SofaScore tournament strings

4) Ensure the odds actor returns the right market

odds_fetch.py / Apify actor_input

Confirm the scraper supports the sport and returns:

event start time

home/away names

moneyline / winner prices

5) Update extraction rules if the sport uses different market labels

odds_extract.py

Add synonyms for the main 2-outcome market:

“Moneyline”, “Match Winner”, “Winner”, “To Win”, etc.

If it’s a sport with draws (soccer), keep it Experimental unless you explicitly switch to 3-way modeling.

6) Run a mapping sanity check

mapper.py

New leagues often need alias rules:

abbreviations

accents/diacritics

“FC”, “SC”, “AFC”, “Utd”, “University”, etc.

Best “next sports” to add (2-outcome friendly)
✅ Easy wins (still 2-outcome)

MLB (Baseball)

Clean moneyline market

Stable schedule volume

Good candidate for production once you confirm scraper coverage

Tennis (ATP/WTA)

True 2-outcome (no draw)

Team matching is player-name matching (different alias problems, but solvable)

Great for a value engine because pricing is frequent

AFL / NRL

Typically 2-outcome (draw is rare but can exist)

Book market naming varies (“Head to Head”)

You’ll want strong team alias mapping (e.g., “Sydney Swans” vs “Swans”)

⚠️ Keep Experimental for now

Soccer leagues (EPL, La Liga, etc.) because most books default to 3-way (Home/Draw/Away).

You can still run 2-outcome if you explicitly choose Draw No Bet or Double Chance, but that’s a different market and needs clear handling.

MMA/UFC is already marked experimental — it’s 2-outcome but data + pricing quirks are real.

Concrete implementation example: add MLB
stats_provider.py routing

Add:

"MLB": _LeagueRoute(
    sport="baseball",
    accept=["mlb", "major league baseball"],
),

league_map.py

Add “MLB” under production leagues.

league_defaults.py (starter defaults)

history_days: 120 (baseball benefits from more history)

lookahead_days: 5–7

min_edge_pct: 2.0–3.0 (start conservative)

odds_min: 1.40

odds_max: 3.50

odds_extract.py

Add market label synonyms (if not already):

“Moneyline”

“To Win”

“Match Winner”

“Winner”

One design rule to keep your engine consistent

Your Elo-based model assumes two outcomes. For any sport where draws are common:

keep it Experimental

and only promote to production once you either:

implement 3-way probabilities, or

explicitly use a 2-way market (Draw No Bet / Asian Handicap 0) and model accordingly.
