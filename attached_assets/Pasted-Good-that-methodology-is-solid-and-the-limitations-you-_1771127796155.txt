Good — that methodology is solid, and the limitations you listed are exactly where the accuracy/calibration gains live. The trick is to improve probabilities (calibration + separation) while keeping the model lightweight.

Here’s the highest-impact upgrade path, in the order I’d implement it.

1) Make home advantage league-specific (and tune it)

Right now you have “a fixed constant”. That’s almost always leaving accuracy on the table.

Do this:

Add HOME_ADV[league] (Elo points)

Tune it by backtest to maximise Brier score (probability accuracy) or log loss, not raw accuracy.

Typical starting ranges to grid-search:

AFL/NRL/NBL: 20–90

NBA: 30–100

NHL: 10–70

Why it helps: home advantage varies massively across leagues and seasons; a wrong constant miscalibrates every probability.

2) Tune K per league + make it dynamic by games played

A fixed K is a compromise between stability and responsiveness.

A) League K tuning

Grid search:

K ∈ {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}

B) Dynamic K (big gain early season)

Track games played per team:

K_eff = K * 1.8 if team has < 10 games

K_eff = K * 1.3 if < 20 games

else K_eff = K

Why it helps: ratings adapt faster when you know less, and stabilize when you know more. Improves both accuracy and confidence separation.

3) Add margin-of-victory weighting (where scores matter)

For AFL/NBL/NBA (and often NRL), Elo updates should reflect how decisive the win was.

A standard approach:

mov = abs(home_score - away_score)

mov_mult = log(mov + 1) * (2.2 / (0.001 * abs(elo_diff) + 2.2))

K_eff = K_eff * mov_mult

Why it helps: blowouts carry more information than coin-flip wins, so the rating moves faster toward truth.

4) Add recency weighting (simple + very effective)

Your training window treats 90 days ago = yesterday. That harms calibration and bucket separation.

Simplest version: decay K by game age in the training build:

Weight games by w = exp(-days_ago / half_life)

Use K_eff = K_eff * w while building ratings from training history (and optionally in test rolling updates too).

Start with half-life:

30–45 days for high-variance leagues

60–90 days for stable leagues

Why it helps: the model becomes more “form-aware” without needing extra features.

5) Split ratings: home-strength and away-strength (small complexity, big calibration gain)

Instead of one rating per team, maintain:

R_home[team]

R_away[team]

When predicting:

compare R_home[home] vs R_away[away]

When updating:

update those two ratings only.

Why it helps: some teams systematically over/underperform at home/away, which your current model can’t represent.

6) Calibrate probabilities after Elo (this is the calibration fix)

Even “perfect” Elo ratings can be miscalibrated because the logistic denominator (your “400”) isn’t universal.

Option A: tune the Elo scale (best first step)

Generalize:

p_home = 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((r_away - r_home) / SCALE))
Grid search SCALE ∈ {250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600} per league.

This alone often fixes “70% doesn’t win 70%”.

Option B: Platt scaling / isotonic regression (if you want stronger calibration)

Use the test predictions (or better: CV folds) and fit:

Platt: logistic regression on logit(p)

Isotonic: non-param monotonic calibration

Report Brier score + reliability plot per bucket.

Why it helps: you explicitly force “predicted probability ≈ observed frequency”.

7) Change what you optimise: add proper scoring rules and confidence-lift

If you only chase accuracy, you’ll plateau quickly.

Add these backtest outputs:

Brier score (lower is better)

Log loss (lower is better)

Bucket lift: (Accuracy at 70%+) − (Accuracy overall)

Top-N accuracy (top 10 by confidence / top 10 by edge)

Then tune parameters to:

minimise Brier/log loss

maximise bucket lift

That directly targets “better calibration” and “more separation”.

A practical “do this now” plan

If you want the fastest improvement with minimal code churn:

Implement per-league grid search for: HOME_ADV, K, SCALE

Add dynamic K by games played

Add recency weighting in training build

Re-run backtest and compare: accuracy and Brier + bucket lift
